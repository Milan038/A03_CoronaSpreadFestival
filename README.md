# A03_CoronaSpreadFestival
In this project we aim to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 
We want to design multiple environments, based on real-world situations that have a hard time reopening in the pandemic, such as festivals, schools and offices. Currently, our focus is on correctly modelling a festival with a potential spread of corona.
More specifically, we want to model, in these different environments, the effectiveness of measures that aim to reduce the spread of the virus. Measures such as the use of face-masks, being vaccinated or having a negative test result.
As of now, we work in a software called NetLogo, which is tool to build multi-agent environments.
